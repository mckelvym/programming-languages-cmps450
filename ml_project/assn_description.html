<p></p><p><b>Problem:</b></p><p></p><p>

For this assignment you are to implement, using the Standard ML language,
the <b>Hindley-Milner</b> type checking algorithm, as presented in class
and in section 6.8 of the text, for a subset of ML.
</p><p>
Your solution should read in a sequence of ML statements and either output
that the statements are type correct <b>or</b> report the first type
error encountered if they are not.
</p><p>
Your solution should be able to correctly type check any ML statement composed
of:
</p><ul>
<li>Mathematical expressions involving the binary operators +, -, *, /, div, and mod</li>
<li>String expressions involving the binary operator ^</li>
<li>List expressions involving the binary operators @ and ::</li>
<li>val declarations for integer, real, boolean, string, list, and function variables.</li>
<li>fun declarations where the parameters are all of the types listed above and
whose return values are one of the above.</li>
<li>let expressions with the same restrictions as those for fun declarations.</li>
<li>if-then-else expressions which return one of the above types.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><p>
You are to use the symbol table from <a href="http://web.cacs.louisiana.edu/%7Emgr/450/ML/symtab1.sml">symtab1.sml</a>.
Also, <a href="http://web.cacs.louisiana.edu/%7Emgr/450/ML/arith.sml">arith.sml</a> contains code
for properly parsing mathematical expressions which you must use as a foundation
for your solution.
</p><p>
Here are some sample input functions you can use to read from a file,
<a href="http://web.cacs.louisiana.edu/%7Emgr/450/ML/input.sml">input.sml</a> 
</p><p><b>NOTE TO HARLEQUIN USERS:</b> Select "MLWorks2.0 + Basis"
after installation and remove the first 3 lines of code from arith.sml
before loading it into the listener.
</p><p></p><p>
You may assume that white spaces ( space character, newline, tab ) separate all keywords.
Use the assignment name <b>milner</b> when submitting your implementation from your UCS class account.
