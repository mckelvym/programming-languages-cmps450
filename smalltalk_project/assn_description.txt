Specifications:

You are to implement, using Little Smalltalk, a switch object that
mimics the behavior of the C++ switch statement. When using your
object one should be able to populate it with cases, each providing a
case value, associated block of code to execute, and an optional
break. This will simulate the "writing" of the switch statement in
C++. One should also be able to provide a switch value to the object
which will cause it to search through the known cases and execute the
appropriate blocks. This will simulate the runtime execution of the
C++ switch. Your object should also allow a default case to be
specified.  

Once populated with cases your object should be persistent in that it
should be reusable. It should be possible to provide a switch value,
let the switch execute and then provide another switch value and let
it execute again. Such as when a C++ switch statement is embedded in a
loop statement. 

Your object should, at a minimum, capture the behavior of the C++
switch statement. 

Use the assignment name smalltalk when submitting your implementation
from your UCS 450 class account. 

Your submissions will be graded using the UCS st smalltalk
interpreter.
