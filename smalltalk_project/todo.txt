- What data will be provided to the switch?
       Case value - ex: 2
       Case block - ex: ['hello world']
       Case break - ex: true

       Is it satisfactory to have the user
       provide true or false to determine
       if there should be a break?

- What does it mean to "execute" a block? 
       Return the block?

       Make a statement with the block?
       Ex: b <- ['hey']
	   b.

       Does it include using one of the
       following methods?

       value
       forkWith:
       fork
       whileTrue
       blockContext:
       newProcess
       whileTrue:
       newProcessWith:  

       value and print?
